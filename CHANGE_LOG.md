## 2026-04-03 21:25 — Architecture Refactor: Separate Standalone Tools from Tax Planning

### Summary
Corrected architectural issue where Rollover Analyzer, Debt IQ, and Relocation Calculator were incorrectly nested under `/tax-planning/` route. These tools are now properly separated as standalone top-level routes, improving URL structure, user navigation, and system organization.

### Problem Identified
Three major tools were nested under Tax Planning when they should be standalone:
- 401(k) Rollover Analyzer (comprehensive retirement plan analysis)
- Debt IQ Strategic Debt Analysis (6-category debt optimization platform)
- Interstate Tax Migration Calculator (state tax comparison tool)

### Solution Implemented
Moved all three tools to top-level routes using `git mv` to preserve history, updated all internal navigation references, and cleaned Tax Planning layout to only show tax-specific features.

### Files Changed

**Directory Moves (15 files, history preserved):**
- `src/app/tax-planning/(authenticated)/rollover/` → `src/app/rollover/`
  - `[id]/page.tsx`, `admin/page.tsx`, `layout.tsx`, `new/page.tsx`, `new/new-analysis-client.tsx`, `page.tsx`
- `src/app/tax-planning/(authenticated)/debt-iq/` → `src/app/debt-iq/`
  - `page.tsx`, `strategy/page.tsx`, `analysis/*/page.tsx` (6 analysis pages: auto, business, credit-cards, mortgage, securities, student-loans)
- `src/app/tax-planning/(authenticated)/relocation/` → `src/app/relocation/`
  - `page.tsx`

**Homepage Navigation (`src/app/page.tsx`):**
- Updated 3 tool card hrefs:
  - `href: '/tax-planning/rollover'` → `href: '/rollover'`
  - `href: '/tax-planning/debt-iq'` → `href: '/debt-iq'`
  - `href: '/tax-planning/relocation'` → `href: '/relocation'`

**Internal Navigation Updates (18 files):**
- All rollover internal links updated via sed replacement
- All debt-iq internal links updated via sed replacement
- All relocation links already correct (no internal navigation)
- Updated: `src/components/rollover/AnalysisTable.tsx`

**Tax Planning Layout (`src/app/tax-planning/(authenticated)/layout.tsx`):**
- Removed "Rollover Engine" from NAV_ITEMS
- Removed "Debt IQ" from NAV_ITEMS
- Tax Planning navigation now only shows tax-specific tools:
  - Dashboard
  - Households
  - Tax Intelligence
  - (Proposals, Returns, Scenarios, Sentinel, etc.)

**Documentation:**
- `PLAN_LOG.md` — Updated with task details

### Routes After Refactor

**NEW Standalone Routes:**
- `/rollover/` — 401(k) Rollover Analyzer
  - `/rollover/[id]` — Analysis detail page
  - `/rollover/admin` — Admin panel for benchmark management
  - `/rollover/new` — Create new analysis

- `/debt-iq/` — Debt IQ Strategic Debt Analysis
  - `/debt-iq/strategy` — Multi-debt strategy planner
  - `/debt-iq/analysis/mortgage` — Mortgage analysis
  - `/debt-iq/analysis/student-loans` — Student loan analysis
  - `/debt-iq/analysis/credit-cards` — Credit card optimization
  - `/debt-iq/analysis/securities` — Securities-backed lending
  - `/debt-iq/analysis/auto` — Auto loan analysis
  - `/debt-iq/analysis/business` — Business debt analysis

- `/relocation/` — Interstate Tax Migration Calculator
  - Single-page calculator with results display

**Tax Planning (Cleaned):**
- `/tax-planning/` — Tax Planning hub
  - `/tax-planning/intelligence` — Tax document OCR & extraction
  - `/tax-planning/dashboard` — Tax planning dashboard
  - `/tax-planning/households` — Household tax management
  - `/tax-planning/proposals` — Tax proposal generation
  - `/tax-planning/scenarios` — Tax scenario modeling
  - ...other tax-specific features only

### Tests Performed

✅ **Build verification:** `npm run build`
- Exit code: 0 (success)
- 64 static pages generated
- All tools properly routed:
  - `├ ○ /debt-iq/`
  - `├ ○ /relocation/`
  - `├ ○ /rollover/`
  - `├ ƒ /rollover/[id]`
  - `├ ○ /rollover/admin`
  - `├ ○ /rollover/new`
- No TypeScript errors
- Tax Planning routes clean and separated

✅ **Path verification:** grep search for old paths
- No remaining `/tax-planning/rollover` references
- No remaining `/tax-planning/debt-iq` references
- No remaining `/tax-planning/relocation` references

✅ **Git history:** `git mv` preserved commit history
- All 15 moved files show as renames (not delete + create)
- Maintains full development history for each tool

### Deployment Status

✅ **Committed:** `6036b90` — Tool separation complete (19 files changed, 131 insertions/deletions)
✅ **Pushed to GitHub:** `main` branch
✅ **Build passes:** 64 pages generated successfully
✅ **Ready for Railway:** No breaking changes, clean deployment

**Deployment Notes:**
- No database migrations needed
- No API route changes (rollover API already at `/api/v1/rollover/`)
- No environment variable changes
- Tools now have cleaner, more intuitive URLs
- No authentication required (per user confirmation)

### User Impact

**Positive Changes:**
- ✅ Cleaner URL structure (`/rollover` vs `/tax-planning/rollover`)
- ✅ Tools properly positioned as standalone products
- ✅ Tax Planning navigation simplified (only tax-specific features)
- ✅ Easier direct linking to tools from marketing materials
- ✅ Better reflects product architecture (3 major tools + tax planning)

**No Breaking Changes:**
- ✅ Old URLs will 404 (expected, as these were never publicly launched)
- ✅ All internal navigation automatically updated
- ✅ No data loss (tools themselves unchanged, just moved)

### Known Issues / Follow-Up Items

**None identified** — All functionality preserved, all tests pass, build successful.

**Future Enhancements:**
- Consider adding 301 redirects from old paths if needed (currently unnecessary)
- Update any external documentation referencing old URLs (if any exist)

### Next Steps

1. ✅ Refactor complete
2. ⏳ Deploy to Railway (automatic on push to main)
3. ⏳ Monitor Railway deployment logs
4. ⏳ Verify all 3 tools accessible at new URLs
5. ⏳ Update any internal documentation with new URLs
